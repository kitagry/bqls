For example, the following query generates an error:`SELECT CAST(\"apple\" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;\n`If you want to protect your queries from these types of errors, you can use\n`SAFE_CAST`. `SAFE_CAST` replaces runtime errors with `NULL` s. However, during\nstatic analysis, impossible casts between two non-castable types still produce\nan error because the query is invalid.`SELECT SAFE_CAST(\"apple\" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;\n/*--------------*\n | not_a_number |\n +--------------+\n | NULL         |\n *--------------*/\n`Some casts can include a [format clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#formatting_syntax), which provides\ninstructions for how to conduct the\ncast. For example, you could\ninstruct a cast to convert a sequence of bytes to a BASE64-encoded string\ninstead of a UTF-8-encoded string.The structure of the format clause is unique to each type of cast and more\ninformation is available in the section for that cast.If you are casting from bytes to strings, you can also use the\nfunction, [`SAFE_CONVERT_BYTES_TO_STRING`](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#safe_convert_bytes_to_string). Any invalid UTF-8 characters\nare replaced with the unicode replacement character, `U+FFFD`.Other conversion functionsYou can learn more about these conversion functions elsewhere in the\ndocumentation:Conversion function\nFrom\nTo\n\n[ARRAY\\_TO\\_STRING](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions#array_to_string)\nARRAY\nSTRING\n\n[BOOL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#bool_for_json)\nJSON\nBOOL\n\n[DATE](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#date)\nVarious data types\nDATE\n\n[DATE\\_FROM\\_UNIX\\_DATE](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#date_from_unix_date)\nINT64\nDATE\n\n[DATETIME](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/datetime_functions#datetime)\nVarious data types\nDATETIME\n\n[FLOAT64](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#double_for_json)\nJSON\nFLOAT64\n\n[FROM\\_BASE32](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#from_base32)\nSTRING\nBYTEs\n\n[FROM\\_BASE64](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#from_base64)\nSTRING\nBYTES\n\n[FROM\\_HEX](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#from_hex)\nSTRING\nBYTES\n\n[INT64](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#int64_for_json)\nJSON\nINT64\n\n[PARSE\\_DATE](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#parse_date)\nSTRING\nDATE\n\n[PARSE\\_DATETIME](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/datetime_functions#parse_datetime)\nSTRING\nDATETIME\n\n[PARSE\\_JSON](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#parse_json)\nSTRING\nJSON\n\n[PARSE\\_TIME](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#parse_time)\nSTRING\nTIME\n\n[PARSE\\_TIMESTAMP](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#parse_timestamp)\nSTRING\nTIMESTAMP\n\n[SAFE\\_CONVERT\\_BYTES\\_TO\\_STRING](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#safe_convert_bytes_to_string)\nBYTES\nSTRING\n\n[STRING](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#string)\nTIMESTAMP\nSTRING\n\n[STRING](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#string_for_json)\nJSON\nSTRING\n\n[TIME](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#time)\nVarious data types\nTIME\n\n[TIMESTAMP](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp)\nVarious data types\nTIMESTAMP\n\n[TIMESTAMP\\_MICROS](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp_micros)\nINT64\nTIMESTAMP\n\n[TIMESTAMP\\_MILLIS](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp_millis)\nINT64\nTIMESTAMP\n\n[TIMESTAMP\\_SECONDS](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp_seconds)\nINT64\nTIMESTAMP\n\n[TO\\_BASE32](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#to_base32)\nBYTES\nSTRING\n\n[TO\\_BASE64](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#to_base64)\nBYTES\nSTRING\n\n[TO\\_HEX](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/string_functions#to_hex)\nBYTES\nSTRING\n\n[TO\\_JSON](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#to_json)\nAll data types\nJSON\n\n[TO\\_JSON\\_STRING](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#to_json_string)\nAll data types\nSTRING",
